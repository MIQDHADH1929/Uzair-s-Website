      <h2>Endangered Butterflies</h2>
      <p class="lead">Populations are declining in many regions. Conservation focuses on restoring habitat, reducing chemicals, and monitoring trends.</p>

      <div class="panel" style="padding:16px; margin-top:12px;">
        <div class="callout" role="note">
          <strong>Why the decline?</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Habitat loss – Urban development, agriculture, and deforestation destroy butterfly habitats.</li>
            <li>Climate change – Alters temperature and weather patterns, affecting migration and breeding.</li>
            <li>Pesticide use – Chemicals kill caterpillars, adults, and destroy nectar plants.</li>
            <li>Pollution – Air, soil, and water contamination damage ecosystems.</li>
            <li>Invasive species – Non-native plants replace essential host plants.</li>
            <li>Loss of host plants – Caterpillars cannot survive without specific plants.</li>
            <li>Over-collection – Rare butterflies are sometimes collected illegally.</li>
            <li>Predation – Increased predators due to ecosystem imbalance.</li>
            <li>Light pollution – Disrupts butterfly navigation and behavior.</li>
            <li>Habitat fragmentation – Isolated populations reduce genetic diversity.</li>
          </ul>

            <h3>What helps</h3>
            <p>Protecting endangered butterflies involves conserving and restoring natural habitats, planting native host and nectar plants, and reducing pesticide use. Creating butterfly-friendly gardens and wildlife corridors supports their survival. Public awareness, research, and legal protection also play vital roles in ensuring these species recover and continue contributing to healthy ecosystems.</p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Community Science</h3>
            <p>Community science encourages people to help study and protect butterflies by recording sightings, monitoring populations, and sharing data with researchers. Projects like butterfly counts and tagging programs raise awareness and provide valuable information. This collective effort supports conservation, helping scientists track trends and protect endangered species more effectively.</p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>Education plays a key role in protecting endangered butterflies by teaching communities about their importance, threats, and conservation methods. Schools, workshops, and awareness campaigns inspire people to take action, such as planting butterfly gardens and reducing pesticide use, fostering a culture of responsibility toward preserving these delicate species.</p>
